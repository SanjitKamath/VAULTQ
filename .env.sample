# VaultQ .env Sample
# This is a sample .env file for VaultQ. It contains the necessary environment variables to configure the VaultQ application.
# Copy the contents of this file into a .env and store a secure admin token there.
# This token will be used to authenticate with Vault and should have the necessary permissions to manage secrets and policies."

# VAULTQ_ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=1 enforces HTTPS-only cookies; for local HTTP/non-TLS testing (see VAULTQ_SERVER_URL note below), set VAULTQ_ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=0 or use an environment-specific override.
VAULTQ_ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=1
# Set to 1 only when you want global mTLS (browser will prompt for client cert).
VAULTQ_REQUIRE_MTLS=0

# Doctor app / client API target.
# VAULTQ_SERVER_URL=https://127.0.0.1:8080 for local HTTPS requires creating and trusting a local self-signed cert.
# Generate certs via your local TLS setup docs/scripts (for example openssl), then trust the cert in your OS/browser trust store.
# For local non-TLS testing only, set VAULTQ_SERVER_URL to an http:// endpoint instead.
